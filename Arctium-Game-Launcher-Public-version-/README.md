- Allow custom client version & cdn urls  
  Useful for launching older clients or serving data from your own CDN

## Special Request <3
Please do NOT remove the name `arctium` from the final binary.
Blizzard filters their crash logs based on localhost and the string `arctium` in the binary name. 

### NOTE FOR SERVER CONNECTIONS
* A valid certificate matching your authentication/bnet server host name.
  That certificate needs to be loaded by the authentication/bnet server too

There are no binary releases of this version. Our **full-featured** launcher has binary releases at https://arctium.io
